# Satellite Simulation Project

## Overview

This project is a WebGL-based 3D simulation of a satellite orbiting Earth. It features realistic lighting, textures, and motion, providing an immersive visual experience. The project is developed using JavaScript and WebGL technologies.

## Features

- Realistic 3D rendering of Earth and a satellite.
- Smooth animation of the satellite orbiting Earth.
- Interactive camera controls to view the simulation from different angles.
- Detailed lighting and texturing to enhance realism.

## Installation

To run this simulation, follow these steps:

1. Download the zip file containing the application. It should contain following files:
   - app.js
   - helper.js
   - index.html
   - earth.jpg
   - README.md
2. Open the file 'index.html' in your browser. Ensure you use a browser that supports WebGL e.g:
   - Google Chrome
   - Mozilla Firefox
     You might encounter issues with the application if opened in different browser than those listed above.

## Usage

- View Controls:

  - Rotate the view by clicking and dragging the mouse.
  - Zoom in/out using the mouse wheel.
  - Adjust the satellite's orbit with arrow keys:

- Control animation:
  - LeftArrow: Increase the size of an orbit
  - RightArrow: Decrease the size of an orbit
  - UpArrow: Increase the speed of the satellite
  - DownArrow: Decrease the speed of the satellite
  - Space: Stop the satellite
