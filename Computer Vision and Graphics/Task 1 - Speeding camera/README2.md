# Speeding camera simulation

## Overview

The simulator uses image processing tools to detect the car, to then measure the speed of the vehice and its dimennsions.

## Features

- Speed calculation based on image analysis.
- Vehicle size measurement (length and width).
- Color detection to identify red vehicles.
- Special handling for fire trucks based on size and color.

## Usage

To run this simulation, follow these steps:

- Open the Matlab application, and set the directory to use the folder where the application is located.

- Run the 'Test' file with the pictures that are in the folder. Pictures submited by the user might not be correctly calculated and displayed.

## Acknowledgments

- Pictures used for this simulation are supplied by the University of Portsmouth
